## Executive Summary
This dataset provides a detailed overview of the United Kingdom’s energy consumption, covering 17 distinct energy sources alongside total consumption figures. Measured in million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) — where 1 mtoe = 42 petajoules (42 × 10^15 J) — it includes a valuable metric: the percentage of total consumption sourced from renewables.
The dataset integrates cross-boundary adjustments (accounting for energy use by UK residents abroad and excluding foreign residents in UK territory) and applies these adjustments to bioethanol and biodiesel data. All values are reported to three decimal places, with total figures based on raw data (possible rounding discrepancies).

The analysis reveals a notable upward trajectory in renewable energy adoption, marked by:

A 35% surge in renewable consumption between 1993 and 1994 (a pivotal inflection point).
Gradual yet sustained growth despite intermittent fluctuations.


**Wind/Wave/Tidal** emerging as the most rapidly growing renewable category.
The study identifies the top 5 renewable energy sources in 2020:
- Wind/Wave/Tidal
- Wood Energy
- Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
- Biomass
- Biodiesel
The findings underscore the critical role of policy, technology, and investment in sustaining momentum toward a cleaner, low-carbon energy future.
## Dataset Overview
- Sources Covered: 17 distinct energy sources + total consumption.
- Units: Million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe).
- Conversion: 1 mtoe = 42 petajoules = 42 × 10^15 joules.
- Rounding: All figures reported to 3 decimal places; totals may not sum exactly due to rounding.
- Adjustments: Cross-boundary correction for UK residents abroad / foreign residents in UK territory (applied to bioethanol and biodiesel).

## Conclusion
The dataset confirms the UK’s significant progress in renewable energy adoption over the last three decades. Wind, waste-to-energy, and biomass sectors have grown into substantial contributors, while traditional sources like wood maintain consistent relevance. The trajectory, though occasionally uneven, demonstrates resilience and adaptability in the renewable sector.
Sustaining this momentum will require:

- Continued policy commitment.
- Increased investment in emerging technologies.
- Broader international cooperation.
The findings reinforce that renewables are no longer peripheral—they are central to the UK’s energy strategy, and the next phase demands both stability and innovation.
